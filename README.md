# GraphHiC

Codes for the manuscript "Improved Hi-C contact matrices via genome graphs: Hardness and Heuristics". Here are the instructions for generating the graph-based Hi-C contact matrices and inferring sample genome from genome graphs step by step.

## Genome Graph construction

This step can be omitted if you already have a directed acyclic genome graph. `cg`
